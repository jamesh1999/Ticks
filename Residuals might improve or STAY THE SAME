Residuals might improve or STAY THE SAME
( Should eventually reach perfect fit )

R^2 negative numbers ARE worse than 0


B=P-1 A P
PB = AP
PBv=lPv=APv

det(B-lI)=det(P-1AP -lI)

56
A^T : same eigen values as A
A^T (1,1,1,1) = (k,k,k,k) = k*(1,1,1,1)

Perpendicular & the in plane

Generalize eigenvector/value
A^T = lA

Symmetric/Antisymmetric matrices l = +/-1

pi/4 is less than 1 = fast convergance

ln(f) = ln((1+m) * 2^exp)
	= ln(1+m) + exp ln2
