Mat PDE Notes -
2 - Get to most general case : fourier series
  - Apply boundary conditions after
  - With constants you can absorb imaginary parts
  - Multiply through sin(mx) then integrate [0,pi] to "project fourier series"

4 - Waves: easy to check dimensions to see if valid



Checks:
Dimensions
Indices
Limits
