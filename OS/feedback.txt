- Bellman - Ford O(VE)
- Iterate n(Nodes) times not iterate over the nodes



Proof of Dijkstra's:
By contradiction

u.x - Node u has path distance x

u.d >= u.D

Assume u.d > u.D (i.e. shortest path not found)

There exists an edge E(w,v) such that W is in the set of correctly computed shortest paths and V is in the set of incorrectly computed shortest paths

Therefore u.d <= v.d (we chose u first)

But v is on the shortest path so u.D >= v.D

By convergence lemma: we have the shortest distance to v
v.d = v.D

u.D < u.d <= v.d = v.D <= u.D

But u.D < u.D is false
=> Contradiction



- No negative weights except for source ONLY works if no negative cycles

Johnson's all +u.d-v.d in middle of path cancels out => Does not bias against path length
New node because graph may not be connected & using existing node might create negative cycles

Bellman/Matrix scale parallel-y + Constants for Fib-PQ is large
Bellman shows a node in negative cycle - can break an edge to remove cycle?
