Continuity:

Closure:
Grouping of similar elements

Proximity:
Physical grouping on page
Foreground/background - Make distinctions e.g. put ui elements in box to distinguish from background

Similarity:


Cognitive walkthrough

Recording information-what worked/didn't and WHY
Redesign

Heuristic analysis - multiple evaluators

Might not be aware of hidden tabs (visibility--)

Keyboard shortcuts (efficiancy)

Non visual objects - unclear

Difficult to evaluate own task flow diagram because it is what feels logical to you already

Mental idea of how application will work influence interaction

External might include e.g. shopping list & other aids

Sensory buffer - short term (on the spot)
Working memory - 10s or so, current state (7+-2 items)
Long term

Attention! S->W
Recall! L->W
Rehearsal! W->L

End body simulation - feedback makes more useful

Assumptions about user knowledge / state of application

Embarassed people give bad information, sample wrong people
Sample just contains people using one prior system - expect new system to behave the same
